# Hobbies

## badminton

<br>In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, which not only helps me relax but also keeps me physically active.

##table tennis

<br>One of my favorite hobbies is playing table tennis. I find it to be an exciting and fast-paced sport that requires quick reflexes, precision, and strategy. Whether I'm playing with friends or practicing alone, table tennis always helps me stay active and sharpens my focus. I enjoy the thrill of a good rally and the satisfaction of improving my skills over time. It's not just a game for meâ€”it's a way to relax, have fun, and challenge myself.
